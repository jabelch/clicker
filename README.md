clicker
=======

This is an exploit of the Response Card LCD "clicker" (or similar devices from Turning Technologies) using one of the 
many nRF24L01 wireless modules readily (and cheaply) available on e-bay.
These "clickers" are being used in applications where security is necessary, but it is lacking.
We aim to further expose the weaknesses found in this technology (see Previous Research) so users can make informed 
and responsible decisions with security in mind.
